# Progress (Updated: 2025-12-24)

## Done

- Fixed post-format lint break (duplicate import) and cleaned unused eslint-disable directives. Verified type-check and tests pass; lint has warnings only (deferred).

## Doing

- Preparing commit on origin/dev with documentation + verification status.

## Next

- Optionally address remaining lint warnings (react-hooks deps + inline-style warnings) if/when warnings become blocking.
