# E‑Ink Mode (Theme + Motion Reduction + Contrast Presets)

## Metadata
- Status: Proposed
- Priority: P1 (Differentiation / Accessibility)
- Effort: S–M
- Target Release: TBD

## Problem Statement
E‑ink Android devices and e‑ink-like usage (high contrast, reduced animations, minimal shadows) have unique needs. Competitor readers explicitly target this niche with monochrome/e‑ink themes.

Evidence:
- Mihon issue: “Eink friendly theme” (explicit request): https://github.com/mihonapp/mihon/issues/1747
- Mihon releases mention “Monochrome theme (made with e-ink displays in mind)” (feature shipping): https://github.com/mihonapp/mihon/releases

## Proposed Solution
Add an optional **E‑ink Mode** toggle that applies a curated set of UI and reader rendering changes:
- Monochrome theme preset(s)
- Disable shadows/elevations where possible
- Reduce or disable animations/transitions
- Increase contrast and simplify surfaces
- Optional: larger default font / stronger paragraph spacing

## Requirements

### Functional
- Toggle in Settings > Display (or Theme).
- Optional auto-detect (heuristic) later: detect if device is known e‑ink (not required initially).
- Applies across app UI and reader WebView styles.

### UI
- Provide 2 presets:
  - “E‑ink Light” (white background, dark text)
  - “E‑ink Dark” (dark background, light text) for non-e‑ink AMOLED
- Preview chip and brief explanation.

### Technical
- Theme layer: add an `isEinkMode` setting and route through existing theme provider.
- WebView reader CSS: add an e‑ink CSS profile (no gradients, no shadows, no fixed background images).
- Animation layer: where using Reanimated/animated transitions, reduce duration or disable when flag set.

## Success Metrics
- Increased retention for users enabling e‑ink mode.
- Reduced complaints about readability/ghosting.

## Implementation Plan
1. Add setting + theme tokens for monochrome.
2. Apply to core UI components (cards, menus, bottom sheets).
3. Add WebView CSS profile.
4. Add “reduce motion” adjustments.
